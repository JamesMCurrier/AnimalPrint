# AnimalPrint
Replacement for Python's boring built in print function

To use with another python script, place AnimalPrint.py in the same directory as it.
Then add the following line to the script you want to use it with...

--------------------------
from FancyPrint import *
--------------------------

You can also test it out by running AnimalPrint.py directly
