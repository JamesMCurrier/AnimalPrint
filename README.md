# AnimalPrint
Replacement for Python's boring built in print function

### Essentially cowsay on steroids

## How to Use
`git clone https://github.com/JamesMCurrier/AnimalPrint.git` or [click here to download](https://github.com/JamesMCurrier/AnimalPrint/archive/master.zip)

To use with another python script, place AnimalPrint.py in the same directory as it.

Then add the following line to the top of the script you want to use it with...

```python
from AnimalPrint import print
```

You can also test it out by running AnimalPrint.py directly.

## Running Tests
### Running directly

Run AnimalPrint.py with Python

When prompted "Pick a friend, or enter '?' to view all options: ", type `turtle` and press enter.

When propeted "Message (leave blank for fortune): " type `Hello World!` and press enter.

A turtle saying "Hello World!" should appear.

### With another script

Run testfile.py with Python.

When prompted, enter something (3 times).

You should see an animal saying your message each time.

Now comment out the first line of testfile.py and run it with out AnimalPrint.
